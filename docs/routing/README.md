Routing
=======
This page contains the routing information for every map in Quickie Mountain 2. There are also comments for some levels that have trickier solutions, or explanations on rating choices, cut routes, etc. If you would like to contribute to labbing or make suggestions, read the info below and then contact me with your findings (contact info [here](../../README.md#contact))!


Notation
--------
* D: dashes
* F: forwards
* R: reverse
* N/A: not possible

e.g. "2DR" -> 2-dash reverse


Room Tweaks
-----------
My goal with the randomizer was to make the minimum number of changes possible to make routes possible (e.g. opening up jumpthrus so you can backtrack). If an alternate route requires a change to be made that significantly affects the gameplay of the normal route, it likely will not be added.


Reverse Routes
--------------
Some screens are technically possible to complete in reverse, but were not included for one reason or another. I've included the most common reasons below so you don't waste time labbing these screens unecessarily:

1. Screen isn't interesting (e.g. fall straight down) / camerawork too complex / bad spawn options. These are the main subjective reasons for cutting rooms, all of which will be in comments for that room in the routing tables.
2. Rooms with a Badeline Boss or where a Badeline Orb launches you to the next screen are not possible in reverse due to how they are coded.
3. Rooms with a Theo gate at the end are not possible in reverse.
4. Exits with a non-persistent dash block at the end (i.e. reappears after retry) are not possible in reverse.
